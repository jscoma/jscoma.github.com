                            Hello, my name is Jade Scoma. I have always been fascinated with technology and how we use it to interact with the 
                            world around us. This led me in my decision to attend Arkansas Tech University with the determination to graduate with a 
                            Bachelors Degree in Computer Science. After four years, I finally got my diploma in May of 2017. With my 
                            degree comes the understanding of all the fundamentals in programming as well as many of the advanced topics. 
                            However, I believe that a good programmer is one that not only knows how to code, but also enjoys coding for the 
                            benefit of others.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            During my last year of college I decided to take on an internship to help further my knowledge and experience. While at my 
                            internship with Superior Forestry Service, I learned what it is like to work with a company and what is expected of 
                            me. I not only learned how to be a better programmer during this time, but also gained the understanding of how to cooperate with 
                            others and work as a team to solve design decisions.    
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            Now I am ready to begin my career by helping out an organization through analyzing, building, and maintaining 
                            software solutions. With the knowledge and experience I have gained over the last four years I believe that I 
                            can help with advancement in a company towards any path they choose.    
                            </p>
